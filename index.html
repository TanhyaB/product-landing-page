                <h1>All About Learning Styles</h1>
                <p>It's tempting to try to pin down one "perfect" way of learning. But it can also be dangerous.
                    Everyone's approach to learning is based on a complex mix of strengths and preferences.
                    And we absorb and apply new concepts, skills and information in different ways at different times.

            <h2>Visual</h2>
            <p>Visual learners are individuals who prefer to
                take in their information visually—be that with
                maps, graphs, diagrams, charts, and others.
                However, they don’t necessarily respond well
                to photos or videos, rather needing their information
                using different visual aids such as patterns and shapes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learning">
            <h2>Auditory</h2>
            <p>Auditory learners are individuals who learn better when they take in information in auditory form when it
                is heard or spoken. They are prone to sorting their ideas after speaking, rather than thinking ideas
                through before. Since, to them, saying things out loud helps them understand the concept.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learning">
            <h2>Kinesthetic</h2>
            <p>Kinesthetic learners are individuals who prefer to learn by doing. They enjoy a hands-on experience. They
                are usually more in touch with reality and more connected to it, which is why they require using tactile
                experience to understand something better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learning">
            <h2>Reading/Writing</h2>
            <p>Reading and writing learners consume information best when it’s in words, whether that’s by writing it
                down or reading it. To them, text is more powerful than any kind of visual or auditory representation of
                an idea. These individuals usually perform very well on written assignments.</p>
